Use `rustc` command to compile your code
```bash
rustc hello.rs
```

Build the app
```bash
cargo build
```

Run the app directly
```bash
cargo run
```
---

Create a new project
```bash
cargo new hello_world --bin
```
> We’re passing `--bin` because we’re making a binary program: if we were making a library, we’d pass `--lib`.
